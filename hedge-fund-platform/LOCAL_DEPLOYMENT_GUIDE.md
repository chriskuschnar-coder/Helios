# 🚀 Local Deployment Guide - Complete Setup

## Step 1: Download Project Files

1. **Download all files** from this WebContainer to your computer
2. **Create a folder** called `hedge-fund-platform` on your machine
3. **Copy all files** into this folder

## Step 2: Install Dependencies

Open terminal in your project folder and run:

```bash
npm install
```

This installs all required packages including chart.js, react-chartjs-2, and Supabase client.

## Step 3: Verify Environment Variables

Your project already includes a `.env` file with Supabase credentials. Check that it contains:

```env
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key
```

If the `.env` file is missing, create it with the credentials from your Supabase project.

## Step 4: Set Up Supabase Database (If Needed)

If you need to set up the database schema:

1. Go to your [Supabase Dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard)
2. Open **SQL Editor**
3. Run the migration file: `supabase/migrations/20250829180131_little_flower.sql`

This creates all tables: users, accounts, transactions, compliance_records, crypto_addresses, bank_accounts, wire_instructions.

## Step 5: Run Locally

```bash
npm run dev
```

Your site will be available at: **http://localhost:5173**

## Step 6: Test Full Functionality

### Demo Mode (Works Immediately)
- Email: `demo@globalmarket.com`
- Password: `demo123456`

### Real Authentication (After Supabase Setup)
- Create new accounts that save to your database
- All data persists in Supabase
- Full real-time functionality

## What Works Locally vs WebContainer

| Feature | WebContainer | Local |
|---------|-------------|-------|
| Demo Mode | ✅ Perfect | ✅ Perfect |
| Real Auth | ❌ Limited | ✅ Full |
| Database | ❌ Mock Data | ✅ Real Data |
| Charts | ✅ Works | ✅ Works |
| All Features | ✅ Demo Only | ✅ Production Ready |

## Troubleshooting

### If you get CORS errors:
- Make sure you're running on `localhost:5173` (not 127.0.0.1)
- Check that your Supabase URL and keys are correct in `.env`

### If database queries fail:
- Verify the migration ran successfully in Supabase
- Check that RLS policies are enabled
- Ensure your Supabase project is active

### If charts don't load:
- Restart the dev server: `Ctrl+C` then `npm run dev`
- Clear browser cache
