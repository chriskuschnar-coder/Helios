```

## 🏆 What You'll Have Live:

- **✅ Professional hedge fund website** with institutional design

- **Deployment**: Static site (works anywhere)

## 💡 Why This Solves Everything:

1. **No more CORS issues** - Edge Functions handle all backend operations
2. **Real database** - Your Supabase project stores actual user data
3. **Professional UI** - Institutional-grade design ready for clients
4. **Scalable** - Can handle thousands of users
5. **Secure** - Enterprise-level security with RLS policies
